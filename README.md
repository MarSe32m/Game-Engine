# Game-Engine
Java Game Engine developed by Sebastian
This will be an on going project...
The reason behind is that there are not many easy to use, yet powerful engines for java game development

The architecture will be:
- Graphics (rendering)
- Physics 
- Actions
- Constraints

In the mean time this Engine will be used to make a PC game.
